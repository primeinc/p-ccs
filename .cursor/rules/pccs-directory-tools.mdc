# PCCS Directory Tools Guide

This project contains tools for scraping the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools staff directory and working with the collected data.

## Core Files

- [pccs_directory_scraper.py](mdc:pccs_directory_scraper.py) - Scraper that collects staff directory data
- [pccs_directory_reader.py](mdc:pccs_directory_reader.py) - Utility for reading, filtering, and analyzing the directory data
- [PCCS_TOOLS_README.md](mdc:PCCS_TOOLS_README.md) - Documentation for using the tools

## Scraper Architecture

The [scraper](mdc:pccs_directory_scraper.py) uses Playwright to:

1. Navigate through all 50 pages of the PCCS staff directory
2. Extract staff information including names, titles, locations
3. Extract emails using DOM-based methods (with fallback to script parsing)
4. Save data to both CSV and JSON formats

Key functions:
- `extract_staff_entries()` - Extracts staff info from a single page
- `run()` - Main function that handles pagination and data collection

## Directory Reader Architecture

The [reader tool](mdc:pccs_directory_reader.py) provides:

1. Loading directory data from CSV
2. Filtering by name, title, or location
3. Displaying in various formats (table, JSON, CSV)
4. Generating summary statistics

Key functions:
- `load_directory()` - Loads the CSV data
- `filter_directory()` - Applies filters to the data
- `display_directory()` - Shows data in the requested format

## Usage Workflow

1. Install dependencies (Playwright, pandas, tabulate)
2. Run the scraper to collect data
3. Use the reader tool to analyze, filter, and export subsets of the data

See the [README](mdc:PCCS_TOOLS_README.md) for detailed usage instructions.
