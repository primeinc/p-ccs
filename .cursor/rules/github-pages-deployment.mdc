# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup

This project is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Key Files and Configuration:

* **[package.json](mdc:package.json)**:
  * `"homepage": "https://primeinc.github.io/p-ccs"`: Specifies the expected URL for the deployed site.
  * `"predeploy": "pnpm run build"`: Script that runs the Vite build process before deployment.
  * `"deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"`: Script that uses the `gh-pages` package to push the contents of the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

* **[vite.config.js](mdc:vite.config.js)**:
  * `base: "/p-ccs/"`: Configures Vite to correctly resolve asset paths for a site hosted in a subdirectory (e.g., `username.github.io/repository-name/`).

* **[public/404.html](mdc:public/404.html)**: Custom 404 page that enables SPA routing on GitHub Pages.
  * Implements the client-side redirect technique for maintaining routes in a SPA.

* **[index.html](mdc:index.html)**: 
  * Contains the GitHub Pages SPA routing script that works with 404.html.
  * Includes static Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social media crawlers.
  * Uses absolute URLs with the proper base path for all resources.

## SEO Considerations:

* **Static Metadata**: Since GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side rendering, metadata for social media crawlers is implemented with static tags in the HTML.
* **Image Paths**: All image URLs in metadata use absolute paths including the base path (`/p-ccs/`).
* **Base URL**: The full URL structure (`https://primeinc.github.io/p-ccs/`) is used for all canonical and Open Graph URL tags.

## Deployment Process:

1. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy
   ```
   This command first runs `pnpm run build` (due to the `predeploy` script) and then `gh-pages -d dist`.

2. **GitHub Repository Settings**:
   * Navigate to the repository settings on GitHub (`https://github.com/primeinc/p-ccs/settings/pages`).
   * Under "Build and deployment":
     * Source: "Deploy from a branch"
     * Branch: `gh-pages`
     * Folder: `/ (root)`
   * Save the settings.

The site should then be available at `https://primeinc.github.io/p-ccs`.
