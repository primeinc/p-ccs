# Project Overview

This is a React project built with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. It also utilizes PNPM as the package manager.

## Key Files and Directories:

*   **`[package.json](mdc:package.json)`**: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
    *   Dependencies include React, ReactDOM, Vite, Tailwind CSS, as well as UI component libraries like Radix UI, Shadcn/ui (`[components.json](mdc:components.json)`), and `lucide-react` for icons.
    *   Scripts like `dev` (starts Vite dev server), `build` (creates a production build), and `lint` are defined here.
*   **`[pnpm-lock.yaml](mdc:pnpm-lock.yaml)`**: The lockfile generated by PNPM, ensuring consistent dependency installations.
*   **`[vite.config.js](mdc:vite.config.js)`**: Configuration file for Vite, the build tool and development server.
*   **`[tailwind.config.js](mdc:tailwind.config.js)`**: Configuration for Tailwind CSS, including theme customizations and content sources.
*   **`[postcss.config.js](mdc:postcss.config.js)`**: Configuration for PostCSS, used by Tailwind CSS.
*   **`[index.html](mdc:index.html)`**: The main HTML entry point for the application, typically located in the project root.
*   **`[src/](mdc:src)`**: Contains the main source code for the application.
    *   **`[src/main.jsx](mdc:src/main.jsx)`**: The JavaScript entry point for the React application. It renders the root React component (`App` or similar) into the `index.html`.
    *   **`[src/App.jsx](mdc:src/App.jsx)`**: Often the root React component, which then renders other components.
    *   **`[src/ArtifactCode.jsx](mdc:src/ArtifactCode.jsx)`**: A large React component that appears to contain significant UI and logic for the P-CCS Art Show application.
    *   **`[src/index.css](mdc:src/index.css)`**: Global CSS styles and Tailwind CSS directives.
    *   **`[src/components/](mdc:src/components)`**: Likely contains reusable UI components used throughout the application. Many of these might be related to Shadcn/ui.
    *   **`[src/lib/](mdc:src/lib)`**: May contain utility functions, helper modules, or other shared library code.
    *   **`[src/assets/](mdc:src/assets)`**: For static assets like images, fonts, etc.
*   **`[public/](mdc:public)`**: Directory for static assets that are copied directly to the build output directory without processing by Vite.
*   **`[.eslintrc.cjs](mdc:.eslintrc.cjs)`**: Configuration file for ESLint, used for code linting and maintaining code quality.
*   **`[.gitignore](mdc:.gitignore)`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Development Workflow:

1.  Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2.  Start the development server: `pnpm run dev` (typically available at `http://localhost:5173`)
3.  Build for production: `pnpm run build`

## Key Technologies:

*   **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Vite**: Fast frontend build tool and development server.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.
*   **PNPM**: Fast, disk space-efficient package manager.
*   **Shadcn/ui (via `[components.json](mdc:components.json)` and `[src/components/](mdc:src/components)`)**: Re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Lucide React**: Icon library.

This overview should provide a good starting point for understanding the project structure and how different parts interact.
